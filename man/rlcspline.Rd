\usage{
rlcspline(n = 1, spline, stretch, height)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of simulations to return.}

\item{spline}{The lcspline to simulate from.}

\item{stretch}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 determining the stretch of the spline.
The value between 0 and 1 is shifted and scaled to the minimum and
maximum values of the spline's stretch_sequence.}

\item{height}{A positive numeric value proportional to the height of the spline. The
conditional variance is multiplied by height^2.}
